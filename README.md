# blind_assisstance
OBJECTIVES:
● To provide assistance for the blind people.
● To make Blind people independent.
METHODOLOGY:
MAPPING MECHANISM:
We will build a map of our environment using the ROS2
SLAM and Navigation packages. Hector-SLAM is an algorithm that uses
laser scan data to create a map. SLAM is a popular technique in
which a robot generates a map of an unknown environment (i.e.,
mapping) while simultaneously keeping track of its position within
that map (i.e., localization).
IMAGE PROCESSING:
Using Haar cascade algorithm face detection will be
done.And using basic algorithms we can perform object detection.
VOICE ASSISTANCE:
PICROFT is an open-source voice assistant provided for
Raspberry-pi. Using this we can build our own voice assistant.
Take our voice commands.
OUTCOMES:
● When we discuss its outcome, the primary outcome is that
it can take the person accordingly as required.
● And moreover, it can take the commands from the owner
by sound sensing devices attached to the stick.
● And also, it detects the accessories that are nearby and also
detects the person near to the user who is in their
community.
